                    <h2>We need your help.</h2>
                    <p>Folk art park, also known as black blocks, has been cooperatively used by skateboarders for the past twenty years, until this week. The city of Atlanta has decided to make the blocks un-skateable. </p>
                    <p>The struggle to demonstrate to the public that skateboarding is both constructive and beneficial to outside parties has been constant and perpetual.</p>
                    <p>Without skateboarders occupying black blocks, who will use the plaza? Many may believe that skateboarding has only damaged the plaza. However, this is a gross misconception.</p>
                    <p>Skateboarders have found purpose, and enjoyed the plaza more than any other group. As a plaza that has been largely ignored after its construction for the 1996 olympics, skateboarders have become the sole care takers of black blocks.</p>

                        <p>"For years, Black Blocks has been reliable, a spot you can go to whenever. Tuesday at 2pm? No problem. Sunday morning? Of course. Nowhere else to go? Not looking for the run and gun of most downtown skating? Just trying to mess around and kill a couple hours before or after work? Black Blocks, man. We'll see who's up there.</p>
                        <p> Black Blocks been a staple of the Atlanta scene for the full two decades it's been around. From its inception, it was a dark night spot (unless the full moon lit the white and made it amazingly lit) that was on a list of other night spots that dudes skated once the city "closed". For a while after that, it was a quick warm up and meet-and-greet preceding the filming missions. But around 2002 or 2003, when all the other little rinky-dink DIY spots were getting taken away or turning into busts, Black Blocks started becoming the daytime spot. Once we realized that the cops were letting it slide by driving by without whooping sirens or stopping and threatening tickets, we started to take it in and really appreciate the plaza. We scolded taggers, ran off foul minded drifters, and started cleaning up assorted trash left from the wandering zombies the night before. We started caring for it as our personal space to go. We wanted the area to be as clean, inviting and trouble free as possible. No trouble means no cops, and the first to go at spaces like these, no matter who's at fault, is the skaters.</p>
                        <p>Those were my days. And during those days, skating was growing at extremely fast pace everywhere. There were lots of kids seeing the videos, hearing stories of downtown Atlanta and waiting their turn to come around and see the scene. Going to a skatepark isn't the same as inundating yourself with older and smarter locals. Being around that environment is completely different than almost anything someone will experience anywhere else. There's an unspoken level of respect and honor to come through the ranks of grom, to ripper, to local scene builders. There's no rule pamphlet or any message board to get hints and tips, it happens organically and becomes common knowledge the more you are around.</p>
                        <p> I'm 38 now, and when I visit the Blocks, I respect the new dudes in the mix, shooing away trouble minded fools, picking up trash, giving right of way to pedestrians, the same way as we did: unspoken and full of stoke. These dudes care for this spot exponentially more than what any other human thinks of any of the other plazas in Folk Art Park. Love it or hate it, if it wasn't fenced off, you'd be there this weekend to meet up or stay the day. Twenty years, man. I'd love to see it go at least twenty more." <span> - Jeremiah Babb</span></p>

                        <p>"Clocking in at half a city block, Black Blocks is far from perfect. It's smaller than your average skatepark, full of deceivingly high ledges, located at least two blocks from the closest gas station, and situated over two busy highways, ensuring that patrons will be sweating bullets or shivering profusely for over half the year. Regardless, for skateboarders across the southeast, the spot has been a safe haven in a rough patch since the 1996 Olympics came to our fair city. I was barely five years old by that point, so the chances of me providing an accurate history of the spot are slim-to-none. However, I'm more than happy to provide my history of the spot.</p>
                        <p>I started school at Georgia State University in August 2009. Throughout high school, I never had a car, meaning I rarely had the opportunity to skate anywhere other than the Marietta suburbs where I grew up. When I learned how close Black Blocks was to the Georgia State campus (a mere three-block downhill skate from the dorms), I was ecstatic. Finally, I thought, a real skate spot! Black Blocks signified autonomy -- no more bumming rides or walking to the session for me. It didn't take long to realize that, no matter the time or the day of the week, I could just roll down to Black Blocks and meet up with virtually anyone in the metro Atlanta area. I must have spent at least fifty Saturdays sitting on the blocks, learning every trick I could muster, and just hanging out, enjoying the public space. The spot is the building block of too many friendships to count. I've personally bonded with skateboarders from Baltimore, Berlin, Paris, London, and Richmond when they stopped at Black Blocks while passing through Atlanta.</p>
                        <p>If you're wondering why the spot attracts so much attention, it's because Black Blocks is synonymous with southeastern skateboarding across the United States. There's enough room for several skateboarders to roll around without impeding upon one another, the checkerboard ground is instantly recognizable, and it's location and status as a bust-free spot ensured that skateboarders were generally left unperturbed. Because of this, the spots' energy is palpable. Look closely in any clip filmed there, and you'll encounter a never-ending stream of recognizable faces either skating or kicking it, waiting to see if the group would move elsewhere, as well as the hustle and bustle of Atlanta in the background. It's a home away from home, not just for those who frequent it daily, but for anyone worldwide who wanted to experience some southern hospitality, coupled with world-class skateboarding.</p>
                        <p>Black Blocks was unceremoniously fenced off September 19, 2016, with no warning from the city of Atlanta. After twenty years without a major disturbance, skateboarders across the world were taken aback. Very few public plazas are so organically accommodating of skateboarders, and it would be a shame to exclude the main proprietors of Folk Art Park from future enjoyment of the space. Skateboarders flock to these kinds of spaces, and the nature of the open, public plaza is an important aspect of street skateboarding that cannot be duplicated.</p>
                        <p>Atlanta has an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of cities like London and New York City, who have both acknowledged the cultural significance of skateboarding and, in turn, designated preexisting public space for skateboarders. I believe a similar move would be nothing but beneficial for all parties involved. I hope the story of Black Blocks won't stop with my generation, in 2016; rather, that the city of Atlanta will allow skateboarders to continue writing for years to come." <span> - Andrew Murrell </span> </p>

                        <p>"I moved to Atlanta in 1996 as the Olympics were winding down. The locals told me of the crackdown on skateboarding that occurred during the games and of the glory days that came before. To me, however, Atlanta in the late 90s was a skateboarding wonderland. My friends and I would explore it late at night and early into the morning. While most slept in the suburbs, we took advantage of the quiet streets, marble ledges, slanted walls, and sometimes a nearly desolate monochromatic public space that we named Black Blocks.</p>
                        <p>Over the next decade most of the truly great skate spots in Atlanta were made off-limits via fences, security guards, police task forces, and defensive architecture. Black Blocks was left as the only safe-space for street skaters, and over the years the spot has emerged as the prime symbol of local skate culture. While Black Blocks evolved into a sacred space, the skateboarders adapted to and transformed the local social ecology. The homeless and the drug dealers learned to stay away and we became de facto stewards of the odd triangle plaza on the edge of downtown.</p>
                        <p>Black Blocks became our home. Now, our home has been fenced off, and will soon be made uninhabitable. Only once in my 27 years of skateboarding have I been able to convince a cop not no kick me out of a skate spot. The spot was Black Blocks and the officer was a seemingly decent human being who was new to the force. I told him of our history of being excluded and relegated to this marginal space and of our role in the delicate social ecology of the area. He listened, then he demonstrated tolerance and sound judgement by walking away. Let’s hope the City of Atlanta can do the same now." <span> - Chris Head </span></p>
